Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

SOLUTION:

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size()-1;
        while(left<=right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(arr[mid]-mid-1<k){
                left = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return left+k;
    }
};
