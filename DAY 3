Capacity Functions:

size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.
max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the vector can hold.
capacity() – Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated to the vector expressed as number of elements.
resize(n) – Resizes the container so that it contains ‘n’ elements.
empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.
shrink_to_fit() – Reduces the capacity of the container to fit its size and destroys all elements beyond the capacity.
reserve() – Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain n elements.
