Question:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int len = height.size();
        int i=0,j=len-1;
        int area = 0;
        while(i<j){
            int temp = (j-i)*min(height[i],height[j]);
            if(temp>area){
                area = temp;
            }
            if(height[i]<height[j]){
                i++;
            }
            else
                j--;
        }
        return area;
    }
};
